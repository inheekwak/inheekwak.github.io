My name is Inhee, and I am currently working as a research assistant at the Institute for Human Neuroscience at Boys Town National Research Hospital in Omaha, NE, USA. My research interests focus on how stress and trauma impact individuals vulnerable to the dysfunction of mental disorders. I aim to apply computational skills to advance psychological research.

I enjoy hiking, practicing yoga, and running. I have a deep appreciation for nature and love capturing its beauty through photography. In my 20s, I backpacked to several places, including India, South America, Myanmar, Thailand, Finland, and more. On my travel wish list are Australia, Africa, and Egypt.

My name is Inhee, and I am currently working as a research assistant at the Institute for Human Neuroscience at Boys Town National Research Hospital in Omaha, NE, USA. My research interests focus on the dysfunction of mental disorders, particularly depression, and how stress and trauma impact individuals vulnerable to these conditions. I aim to apply computational skills to advance psychological research.
